This file is added in 'doSomeStuff' but will be excluded in the merge
operation.

Some more changes to be merged: what happens now?
There was a conflict, and I needed to tell git to restore the file.

Now it has been renamed in the release branch: what will happen this time?
It was great: the new text was merged into the file with its new name.
